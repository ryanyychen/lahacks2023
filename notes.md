- Worked on backend
  - webscraped UCSD course catalog htmls using BeautifulSoup
  - parsed a CSV in order to get all valid department abbreviations
  - used json and Flask to communicate data to frontend JS
## Problems ##
- UCSD course catalog HTML's were inconsistent in wording, would have varying formats of ands, ors, and commas
  - attempted to fix by using regular expressions in place of course ids
- searching for a list of UCSD department abbreviations
  - gave up and decided to find more department abbreviations than HTMLS, then stored in CSV in order to process and check validity
